### Abstract

In the last few years, post-quantum cryptography has received much attention.
NIST is running a competition to select some post-quantum schemes as standard.
As a consequence, implementations of post-quantum schemes have become important
and with them side-channel attacks. In this paper, we show a timing attack on a
code-based scheme which was submitted to the NIST competition. This timing
attack recovers secret information because of a timing variance in finding roots
in a polynomial. We present five algorithms to find roots that are protected
against timing exploitation.
