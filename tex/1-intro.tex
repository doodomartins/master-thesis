The context of this work relies on the fact that the Shor's algorithm open a lack of security in all current cryptosystem. However, there exists a few class of algorithm that are still secure, against a classical and a quantum computer. One of the most relevant class of algorithm, called code-based algorithms, are based on the classical work proposed by Robert J. McEliece \cite{mceliece1978public}. This classical algorithm uses an error correcting code, that able to recovery errors added to a message, this
