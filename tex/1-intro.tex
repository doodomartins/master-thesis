The context of this work relies on the fact that the Shor's algorithm open a lack of security in all current cryptosystem. However, there exists a few class of algorithm that are still secure, against a classical and a quantum computer. One of the most relevant class of algorithm, called code-based algorithms, are based on the classical work proposed by Robert J. McEliece \cite{mceliece1978public}. 

This classical algorithm uses an error correcting code, that able to recovery errors added to a message, this was made through the redundancy added to the original message. Using the idea behind the coding theory, and protecting some parts of the code, only who has knowledge of the code was able to recovery the original message, we can construct a scheme that are secure in a quantum era.

Therefore we can construct schemes based on code secure, their implementation could not be secure. Based on this fact, many cryptosystems are creating ways to blinding their implementations.
