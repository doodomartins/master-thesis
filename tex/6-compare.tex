In this chapter, we present an analysis of the five presented methods in the Chapter~\ref{ch:roots}. The first two analyses have a focus on the complexity and performance of the algorithms. However, we are not interested only in efficient techniques, our primary goal was to achieve a method with no information leakage against a timing side-channel attack. Hence, we demonstrate a time-variance analysis for each proposed root-finding method. After that, we present a security analysis of the algorithm. We remark that $n = 2^m$ are the size fields, and $t$ the degree of the polynomial.

\section{Complexity analysis}
In order to compare the complexity of the algorithm, we use the Big $\mathcal{O}$ notation. This asymptotic notation permits us to classify the algorithms according to their behaviour when the inputs grow towards infinity. 

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\label{tab:complexity}
\caption{Complexity comparison}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Method                                  &                \\ \hline
Exhaustive search                       & $\mathcal{O}(2^mt)$ \\
Permuted exhaustive                     & $\mathcal{O}(2^mt)$ \\
Linearized Polynomials                  & $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$ \\
Constant Linearized Polynomials         & $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$ \\
Berlekamp trace algorithm               & $\mathcal{O}(mt^2)$ \\
Iterative Berlekamp trace algorithm     & $\mathcal{O}(m^2t^2)$ \\
Successive resultant algorithm          & $\mathcal{O}(t^2m^3)$ \\
Constant Successive resultant algorithm & $\mathcal{O}(t^2m^3)$ \\
Rabin root finding                      & $\mathcal{O}(t^2m)$
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As we can note, the most asymptotic efficient method was the Rabin root finding method. However, this asymptotic could not reflect the execution timing of the algorithm for parameters used in code-based schemes. This happens because the big $\mathcal{O}$ notation does not consider constants and the asymptotic complexity was for all $m$ and $t$ greater then $m_0$ and $t_0$ respectively, and the parameters used on code-based cryptosystems could be smaller than the $m_0$ and $t_0$.

\section{Performance analysis}
To give a more careful analysis, we present an execution time analysis of each algorithm. This comparison gives an idea of the real execution cost. All root finding methods were performed over an random polynomial of degree $t$ over $\mathbb{F}_2^m$, for $t = 50$ until $t = 200$ and $n = 2^10$ to $n = 2^{16}$. For each polynomial, we take the average time of 10 executions to minimize the environment noise.

The performance analysis was implemented in SageMath~\cite{sage}, since we want to measure the execution cost with different parameters, the Sage library permits us to change the field with an easy way to perform this analysis. We run all proposed methods in a locally Intel\textsuperscript{\tiny\textregistered} Core(TM) i$7$-$4500$U CPU @ $1.80$GHz. The source code of this attack are available on \url{https://github.com/doodomartins/root-finding/soft-factorization}. The Figure~\ref{fig:time-SRA} to Figure~\ref{fig:time-EXHA} presents the execution time for each root finding method.

For each algorithm presented, we can observe the same behaviour on execution time. Since one of the heavy terms in the complexity was the extension $m$, because they affect the algorithm exponentially, we can note that the algorithms have a different growth for each extension. How higher $m$ is, we observe a higher growth of the runtime. Moreover, we can observe the massive difference between the extension $2^{15}$ to $2^{16}$ on the exhaustive search and in the linearized algorithm. 

On the other hand, the degree of the polynomial affects the execution time of the algorithm linearly. Therefore, the execution time grows more slowly when we are increasing the degree of the polynomial. Additionally, we can note a sharp growth on the Successive Resultant and on the Berlekamp Trace when compared to the Rabin's Algorithm.

\section{Time variance analysis}
The main focus of our work relies on the propose alternatives to compute roots of error locator polynomial without leaking sensitive information against a timing side-channel attack. As previously presented, a naive implementation of the root-finding process allows an attacker to recover the ciphertext and compute a session key of a code-based cryptosystem. In order to avoid this attack, we present five algorithms to compute the roots of a polynomial over binary finite fields. For three of these algorithms, we propose countermeasures to reduce the time variance in its runtime. In this section, we present a time variance analysis of these countermeasures.

In order to measure the time variance, we perform the root-finding procedures and measure the time variance between different executions. This variance is measured in CPU cycles. Figure \ref{fig:55-60-100} presents the time variance for BTA, Linearized Algorithm and Successive Resultant Algorithm for a polynomial with degree $t = \{55, 60, 100\}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}$.

In all methods, when we apply our countermeasure, we increase the average execution time. However, we can note that we considerably reduced the time variance of the algorithm. This variance can be observed on the quartiles in Figure~\ref{fig:100_comp_new}. Since the quartiles inside the box represents 50\% of all measured time, and the other quartiles represent the remained 50\%, ignoring the outliers, we can uphold that our countermeasures reduce the time variance of the root-finding methods.

\section{Security overview}
In order to present a security analysis over our countermeasures showed in Chapter~\ref{ch:roots}. Our main hypothesis on the BIGQUAKE attack was the fact that the time variance on the root-finding process leak information about which kind of polynomial was factorized. This approach leads us to recover a cipher message in a few minutes on a normal laptop. Nonetheless this attack is almost impractical in real cases, we present five countermeasures to avoid this information leakage.

The first countermeasure is based on the direct method, the Exhaustive Search. This method was quite simple to be implemented, and with the permutation applied on the elements before the execution of all evaluations, we shuffle all elements taking of the chance of an attacker guess a root based when an extra operation is executed.

Our second countermeasure is applied on the Berlekamp Trace Algorithm, on Linearized Algorithm and on the Successive Resultant Algorithm. The main idea of this countermeasures was to present a protected implementation. First one, on the Berlekamp's method, we change the recursive classical implementation to an iterative one. Thus we apply the same techniques in all three methods in order to achieve a reduction on the time variance of each algorithm. This simple strategy was used to blind a timing side-channel attacker with a smaller time variance on the algorithm implementation. 

The last one was the usage of a probabilistic algorithm. The Rabin's method execution time is related to a random choice of a polynomial. Each iteration of the algorithm has a different random selection. This randomized behavior results in a different execution time for each different execution. Even more, we cannot determine if the time variance of the algorithm between two executions relies upon the characteristics of the input polynomial or for the random selections. Thus, an attacker measuring the time variance of this algorithm address any sensitive information of a code-based cryptosystem.
