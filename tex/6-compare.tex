In this chapter we will present an analysis over the five presented method on previous section. The first two analysis has focus on the complexity and performance of the algorithms. However, we are not interested only in efficient methods, our main goal was achieve an method with no information leakage against a timing side-channel attack. Hence, we demonstrate an time-variance analysis for each proposed root-finding method. After that, we present an security analysis over the algorithm.

\section{Complexity analysis}
In order to compare the compexity of the algorithm, we 

Let's $m$ be the extension, with $\mathn = 2^m$, and $t$ the degree of polynimial.
