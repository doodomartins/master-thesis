The rising of quantum computing in the last few years became the attention of researchers to schemes that uses cryptography primitives different from discrete logarithm and number factorization. As mentioned before in Chapter \ref{ch:intro}, code-based cryptosystems are those who use fundamental aspects of coding theory to add redundancy into a plain text, to after that, intentionally add some errors and recovery the plain text. 

In this chapter, we explain the first cryptosystem based on coding theory. Furthermore, we present a Round One code-based submission to the NIST standardization process, the BIGQUAKE, and we show the timing side-channel attack performed in the reference implementation of the scheme.

\section{McEliece Cryptosystem}
Robert J. McEliece proposes in 1978 the first cryptosystem based on coding theory, the McEliece cryptosystem was based on the Goppa codes and used them to achieve three main algorithms, i. e. Key Generation, Encryption and Decryption \cite{mceliece1978public}. Figure \ref{fig:code-idea} shows the main of the McEliece Cryptosystem and most of the schemes based on coding theory. Given a plaintext and a public encoding function, anyone can generate a codeword and intentionally add some errors to obtain a ciphertext. From this ciphertext, only who knows the code structure can perform a decoding function and recover the plaintext.

Based on two well know problems, the security of McEliece has remained stable. The first assumption was the hardness of generic decoding, and it is NP-complete and is also consider hard on average. The second assumption that regards the security of the McEliece scheme was the indistinguishability of the code. This second assumption is not as old as the first one, but it relates to old problems of algebraic coding theory and its consider valid for Goppa Codes, as the original proposal. 

The original parameters were designed for $2^{64}$ security bits, but it easily scales up to provide an ample security margin against attackers. Furthermore, the McEliece Cryptosystem suffers many structural attacks, and until today the original proposal is considered secure. It is important to note that many of these attacks based on the same strategy, the information set-decoding. This kind of attack does not affect schemes based on Goppa codes. However, many other families of codes suffer several drawbacks with this attack. 


As proposed in \cite{bernstein2017classic, bardet2017big} on the NIST standardization process, the McEliece cryptosystem, using binary Goppa codes, could be applied to concept a KEM, as defined in Chapter \ref{ch:math}. Based on this fact, we can generalize the cryptosystem in three algorithms: the Key generation and Encryption are defined in Section \ref{sub:mc-def} and Decryption in Section \ref{sub:mc-dec}.

\subsection{Definitions}
\label{sub:mc-def}
In this Section we describe the three main algorithms of the McEliece the McEliece cryptosystem based on irreducible binary Goppa code. 

Algorithm~\ref{alg:keygen} is the key generation of McEliece. First, it starts by generating a binary irreducible Goppa polynomial $g(z)$ of degree $t$. This random selection was made by generating a random polynomial and testing if we generated a irreducible polynomial or not.  Second, it generates the support $L$ as an ordered subset of $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ satisfying the root condition. Third, it is the computation of the systematic form of $\hat{H}$ is done using the Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm. Steps four, five, and six compute the generator matrix from the previous systematic matrix and return secret and public key.

\begin{algorithm}[!ht]
 \KwData{$t, k, n, m$ as integers.}
 \KwResult{pk as public key, sk as secret key.}
 Select a random binary Goppa polynomial $g(z)$ of degree $t$ over $\mathbb{F}_{2^{m}}$\;
 Randomly choose $n$ distinct elements of $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ that are not roots of $g(z)$ as the support $L$\;
 Compute the $k \times n$ parity check matrix $\hat{H}$ according to $L$ and $g(z)$\;
 Bring $H$ to systematic form: $H_{sys} = [I_{k-n}|H']$\;
 Compute generator matrix $G$ from $H_{sys}$\;
 \Return $\quad sk = (L, g(z)) \quad pk = (G)$\;

 \label{alg:keygen}
\end{algorithm}

Given a public key, generated by the Algorithm \ref{alg:keygen} and a message $m$, Algorithm~\ref{alg:2} shows the encryption process of McEliece. The process is simple and efficient, requiring only a random vector $e$ with $w_h(e) \leq t$ and a multiplication of a vector by a matrix.

\begin{algorithm}[!ht]
 \KwData{Public key $pk = G $, message $m \in \mathbb{F}^{k}_{2}$.}
 \KwResult{$c$ as ciphertext of length $n$.}
Choose randomly an error vector $e$ of length $n$ with $w_h(e)\leq t$\;
Compute $c = (m\cdot G) \oplus e$\;
\Return $c$\;
\caption{McEliece encryption.}\label{alg:2}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Decryption}
\label{sub:mc-dec}
Algorithm~\ref{alg:3} gives the decryption part of McEliece. This algorithm consists of the removal of the applied errors using a decoding algorithm. First, we compute the syndrome polynomial $S_c(z)$. Second, we recover the error vector $e$ from the syndrome polynomial. Finally, we can recover the plaintext $m$ computing $c \oplus e$, i.e., the exclusive-or of the ciphertext and the error vector. Note that in modern KEM versions of McEliece, $m\in \mathbb{F}^n_{2}$ is a random bit string used to compute a session key using a hash function. Hence, there is no intelligible information in seeing the first $k$ positions of $m$ with almost no error.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
 \KwData{$c$ as ciphertext of length $n$, secret key $sk= (L, g(z))$.}
 \KwResult{Message $m$}
 Compute the syndrome $S_c(z) = \sum{\frac{c_i}{z+\alpha_i}} \mod g(z)$\;
 Compute $\tau(z) = \sqrt{S^{-1}_{c}(z)+z}$\;
 Compute $b(z)$ and $a(z)$, so that $b(z)\tau(z) = a(z) \mod g(z)$, such that deg($a$)$\leq \lfloor \frac{t}{2} \rfloor$ and deg($b$)$\leq \lfloor \frac{t-1}{2} \rfloor$\;
 Compute the error locator polynomial $\sigma(z) = a^2(z) + zb^2(z)$ and deg($\sigma$) $\leq t$\;
 The position in $L$ of the roots of $\sigma(z)$ define the error vector $e$\;
 Compute the plaintext $m = c \oplus e$\;
 \Return $m$\;
 \caption{McEliece decryption.}\label{alg:3}
\end{algorithm}

In the decryption algorithm, steps $2$-$5$ are the description of Patterson's algorithm~\cite{patterson1975algebraic}. This same strategy can be used in schemes that make use of the Niederreiter cryptosystem~\cite{niederreiter}. As shortly described in Chapter \ref{ch:math}, these schemes differ in their public-key structure, encryption, and decryption step, but both of them, in the decryption steps, decode the message from the syndrome. Others decoding algorithm could be applied to decoding an message with error, but the main focus of this works relies in algorithm with 



The roots of the ELP can be acquired with different methods. Although these methods can be implemented with different forms, it is essential that the implementations do not leak any timing information about their execution. This leakage can lead to a side-channel attack using time differences in the decryption algorithm, as we explore in a scheme in Section~\ref{sec:attack}.
