In this thesis we propose countermeasures to be applied on root finding algorithms in order to achieve a decoding process without leak any sensitive information against a timing side-channel attack. We propose five methods, with different characteristics which can be applied to the root extraction task. Our proposals are based on reduce the time variance, by applying implementation techniques which aims to construct a algorithm without branches and with a constant behaviour. 

Before present the countermeasures, we present a
